# Hybroid Live [![Go](https://github.com/pewpewlive/hybroid/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pewpewlive/hybroid/actions/workflows/go.yml)

Programming language, handcrafted for PewPew.

## ðŸš§ Notice ðŸš§

As Hybroid Live is still in alpha, the language features may have breaking changes when updating. This notice will be removed once the language goes into a stable state.

## Why was Hybroid Live created?

Hybroid Live was created to overcome the limitations and shortcomings of Lua, as well as to provide a better developer experience.

## Pros and cons of Hybroid Live

Benefits of Hybroid Live:

- Contains many new features which are missing in Lua (such as enums, classes, etc.)
- PewPew Live specific features (such as the tick loop or entities)
- State of the art error messages, inspired by Rust and Scala
- Optimized OOP via classes and entities
- Familiar syntax reminiscent of Rust and other popular languages
- Automatic dead-code elimination
- Strict typing
- Native support for fixedpoint numbers (including support for degree-to-radian and float-to-fixedpoint conversion)

However, Hybroid Live does come with certain limitations:

- Not beginner-friendly
- No support for Lua interoperability
